           <span>
                I have worn a few different hats in my life as I have transitioned into my present life as a software engineer. 
                If you are interested in finding out more about my work history you can check out my LinkedIn page. 
                Below you will find information on some of the coding projects I have done for my own satisfaction in my spare time.

                 <span>
                    App to assist players run calculations for the niche wargaming rules Phoenix Command Combat System. 
                    Created frontend UI and managed state for multiple interacting data input/outputs with React/Redux and CSS.

                <span>DKK to AUD</span>
                <span>
                    A simple app built with Go that provides historical data of the exchange rate for Danish Krone to Australian Dollar. 
                    The date range covers from my arrival in Denmark to assist in decisions on best time to send money back to Australia. 
                    Back end is built with Go with data displayed via HTML/CSS. A Redis container is used to cache results for up to six hours to reduce calls for data.
                    Currently deployed on Heroku using a multi-stage Docker build.

                 <span>Movie Search Component</span>
                 <span>
                     A React component (widget) to display movies, TV shows, and people using The Movie DB API. 
                     I used TDD/BDD to build a component that Fetches trending media from API when widget is first loaded. 
                     Users are able to search by name and results are filterable by movie, tv show and person. 
                     There are CSS rules for both mobile and desktop and for truncating long titles and descriptions. 
                     Also features image thumbnail placeholders and a simple caching system for storing prior search queries and results.
